# Mastermind

This is the 2nd Coursework for F28HS Hardware-Software Interface, 2nd year of Bsc Computer Science.

This is the game Mastermind, programmed in C using some inline ARM Assembly code. It is programmed on a Raspberry Pi 2. This is my version of it.

The source code for this program has been encrypted in mastermind.zip due to the coursework being still used. 

If you want to have a look at the code, password can be requested from wrt_95@hotmail.com.
